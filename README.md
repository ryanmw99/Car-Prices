# What Drives the Price of a Car?
The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure the speed of processing. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client—a used car dealership—as to what consumers value in a used car.

# Business Understandings
A car dealership works on the basis that they can sell cars for more than they bought them for. In which case, the business relies on the prediction of the final sale price of the car and whether they will sell for a profit. Other than the profit, the demand of the car is also important for faster inventory turnover. Demand of the car depends on many factors but mostly the drivers' demographic and preferences are key elements. 

# Jupyter Notebooks
The first Jupyter Notebook here provides the first cycle going through the CRISP-DM Process Model. After the first findings and insights, it was necessary to go back to the begining and reapeat the process as it will be explained below shortly. The additional notebooks can be found on here: SUV NoteBook, Sedan NoteBook, and Pickup NoteBook.
